        <h1>Conclusion First (tl; dr)</h1>

<p>The housing </p>

<h1>Population</h1>

<p>As of the 2010 Census 805,000 people live in San Francisco county and the estimated population for 2012 is 825,000. In 1990 and 2000 respectively, the population was 723,000 and 776,000. That means that in the 90s SF grew by 52000 people or 7.2%; in the 2000s by 28000 or 3.6%; and in the last couple of years by 20000 or 2.5%. (Sources: <a href="http://www.census.gov/popfinder/?fl=06075">1</a>, <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/0667000.html">2</a>, <a href="http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/counties/SanFranciscoCounty.htm">3</a>)</p>

<p>There are two things worth noting. First, while the 2000s have been slow compared to the 90s, the population grew by about the same number (about 50000) in the 90s as over 2000 - 2012. Second, more than half of that growth has been over the last couple of years. This is not too surprising, given recent growth of the tech sector. If that growth proves more sustainable than what happened in the 90s, we can expect the population growth over the 2010s to be much faster than over the 90s.</p>

<h1>Housing Stock</h1>

<p>As of the 2010 census, there are 376000 housing units; 123000 are owner-occupied, 222000 are renter-occupied, and 31000 are vacant.
Of the vacant ones, 12000 are for-rent and 3000 are for sale. This means that the average owner-occupied household has 2.6 people in it and the average renter-occupied household has 2.1 people in it. (Source: <a href="http://www.census.gov/popfinder/?fl=06075">1</a>)</p>

<p>The data is unclear about whether the for-rent and for-sale vacancies are counted in the vacancies, so it is unclear whether SF had about 46000 vacant units in 2010, with about 16000 &ldquo;on the market&rdquo; or SF had 31000 vacant units with about half &ldquo;on the market&rdquo;. Assuming, in the best case, that it is the latter, that means that there are about 15000 housing units vacant, which could house another 39000 renters. In the worst case, those vacant units could house 119000 renters. To put that in perspective, those numbers are about 80% of or double the number the population growth over the past 12 years &ndash; just about all of the new population from 2000 - 2012 would fit in the vacant housing units.</p>
