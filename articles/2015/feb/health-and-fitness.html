        <h1>tl; dr;</h1>

<p>If you are going to do one thing, eat well. If you are going to do two things, eat well and lift weights. Eating well means eating real (non-processed) food, enough protein, a lot of vegetables, and not too much. Lift weights means following a program that includes the big 3 (squat, deadlift, and bench press) and whose resistance increases over time (ie you lift heavier weights as you progress). You are an experiment with sample size 1, experiment on yourself as rigorously as possible and measure the results.</p>

<h1>A Warning</h1>

<p>I am not going to get into how I know these things I think I know. The short version is that after developing some extremely bad diet &amp; (lack of) exercise habits I started getting sick very often, was always tired, and got depressed. A trip to the doctor revealed alarming cholesterol levels and a testosterone deficiency. Also, the way I looked was eating away at my self-esteem. In getting out of all that I spent a lot of time learning about how various types of athletes train at various levels and about nutrition. At the same time I got in shape and improved my life in several ways. Here are some pictures I love to show because I&#39;m vain. The first two are taken about 1.5 years apart and the third a couple of months ago, which is 4 years after the first.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/isqhj2p4smlo7vr/Screen%20shot%202012-02-20%20at%209.07.15%20PM.png?dl=1" alt="before-after"></p>

<p>If nothing else you can rationalize listening to me because I&#39;ve executed a successful transformation and then kept it up.</p>

<h1>Habits and Goals</h1>

<p><em>The long term is sooner than you think.</em></p>

<p><em>The hardest question in life is &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Fitness is 80% mental and 50% physical.</em></p>

<p>A good mindset is way more important to health &amp; fitness than any diet, exercise routine, training methodology, protocol, etc. To that effect, being honest with yourself is key. What are you trying to accomplish?</p>

<p>The most common answer here is &ldquo;I don&#39;t know&rdquo; but instead people tend to think &ldquo;I want to be generally healthy&rdquo;, which is the  same thing as not knowing, but more problematic. The problem with &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; is that at best it means different things to different people. For example, my dad used to practice bodybuilding some 20 years ago and he&#39;d have my mom weigh all his food, which a lot of people saw as crazy and as a sign of a bad relationship to food. They were right in some sense: obsessing over the nutritional content of what you eat to the point that you are measuring out portions down to the gram is obsessive. On the other hand, if you are trying to get to sub-6% body fat (or, equivalently, have a very obvious 6-pack) you most likely need to measure your portions down to the gram and adhere to relatively strict regimens. But, &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; meaning different things to different people is the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is that it is meaningless and it is just a way to rationalize whatever habits one would like to keep as &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;. I can probably construct an argument about how eating 3 pizzas a day is healthy.</p>

<p>So, in case you don&#39;t know, I offer you some potential answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>you want your body to look good</li>
<li>you want to live a long time</li>
<li>you want to be alert and feel good most of the time</li>
<li>you want to gain or lose weight</li>
<li>you want to do several of the above without spending too much time on it</li>
<li>you want to do several of the above while still eating certain foods</li>
<li>you want to be able to play sports without getting fatigued</li>
<li>you want to run a marathon</li>
<li>you want to do manual labor all day without getting injured</li>
<li>you want your blood-work to show acceptable levels of cholesterol</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that a lot of these are compatible with each other, so you don&#39;t have to pick one. The bad news is that we, as a civilization, do not know very much about the human metabolism, especially about what happens in the long-term (~decades). So, things like the second one are probably not worth bothering with. The light at the end of the bad news is that we do know quite a bit about effects in the short- and mid-term (~months, ~years). In a nutshell: I can&#39;t tell you how to live a long time or what to do now to ensure that you&#39;ll meet your fitness goals in 50 years, but I can tell you how to achieve certain goals in a couple of years. For one last piece of bad news, most of these things take a couple of years and not a couple of months, though you do start seeing progress a few months in.</p>

<p>Because the time-scales involved are several months to a couple of years, one should focus on building habits (as opposed to doing things that you can get yourself to do for short periods of time). Building habits is a negotiation with yourself, though. When people try to do something too drastic that takes too much willpower they tend to drop the habit quickly. So, for example, you&#39;ll have two problems: the first is that once you start going to the gym consistently it&#39;ll take ~6 months to start seeing results; the second is that it is psychologically hard to get yourself to go to the gym consistently in the first place.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that you are in it for a couple of years can be helpful when you fall out of a certain habit (e.g. when you miss the gym for 2 weeks). You should be kind to yourself and forgive yourself quickly when you fall out of habit. A psychological pitfall that affects a lot of people is that once they fall out of habit for a short period they think that all their progress is destroyed &ndash; this is not the case, a week is only a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>Putting all this together: the right psychological mindset is that you&#39;re developing habits conducive to concrete fitness goals achievable in a couple of years.</p>

<h1>Diet</h1>

<p><em>You are what you eat.</em></p>

<p><em>6-packs are made in the kitchen.</em></p>

<p><em>Show me someone who can&#39;t gain or lose weight and I&#39;ll show you someone who doesn&#39;t track what he eats.</em></p>

<p><em>But I really like nutella.</em></p>

<p>Your diet is the most important thing about your health &amp; fitness.</p>

<p>Some aspects of this should be obvious e.g. you shouldn&#39;t expect to eat 5000 calories a day (ie a lot) and be skinny. But some aspects aren&#39;t so obvious e.g. after a certain point it becomes impossible to make progress in weightlifting without eating enough &ndash; regardless of what you do at the gym.</p>

<h2>Food is Complicated</h2>

<p>Food is very complicated, probably more complicated than you think. Furthermore, the way that food interacts with your body is <em>also</em> very complicated, again probably more than you think. For example, oregano is made of over 60 chemical compounds, most of which are complicated molecules. To make matters worse, here&#39;s a picture of the metabolic pathways for some chemical compounds in your body:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nawxtj18nwvpixn/metabolic-pathways.jpg?dl=1" alt="metabolic pathways"></p>

<p>Again, we, as a civilization, do not understand the way in which all these things interact. We have some ideas, but they are rough and you may be an exception to a given model that works well in many cases. Not only that but the &ldquo;science&rdquo; of what is good nutrition changes every couple of decades in incompatible ways e.g. in the 70s and 80s people though that fats were very bad, which is now widely believed to be wrong. Fortunately, we know how to survive because we&#39;ve been doing it for several hundred thousand years and not because we listen to what people say about nutrition in fitness magazines.</p>

<p>All of this complexity coupled to some thinking around knowns vs unknown-unknowns yields that you should eat food that is as close as possible to how it is found in nature.</p>

<p>Of course, this is remarkably difficult to do in the modern world because it is about impossible to determine whether something really has been chemically processed by humans. For example, wild almonds contain cyanide. You probably shouldn&#39;t eat a wild almond. But, almonds do count as real food even though the almonds that you eat are &ldquo;domesticated&rdquo; because the domestication process mostly involves artificial selection. At the other extreme, candy mostly made up of corn syrup and artificial flavoring is obviously not food. The rule of thumb here is to err as much as possible towards real food even though you won&#39;t know for sure.</p>

<p>Summary: eat real food.</p>

<h2>Macros</h2>

<p>While the chemical composition of food is very complicated, a more macroscopic description of food is relatively straight forward. For most health&amp;fitness goals in 2-year scales, one mostly needs to only worry about food at this macro level. Here macro means macronutrient. Macronutrients are basically categories of nutrients separated by our rough understanding of the short- and mid-term effects they have on the metabolism. There are three of them: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. All food is mostly made up of things that fall in those three categories. Any one food will also contain another several dozen chemical compounds that don&#39;t fall in those categories, but 99% of the mass of the food does fall into the 3 categories.</p>

<p>If you live in the modern western world and don&#39;t pay attention to your diet you most likely eat too many carbohydrates and not enough protein.</p>

<p>Theories on carbohydrates and their effects vary, but it is relatively well established that eating fewer carbs leads to weight loss and that people can live happily (and happier) with very few carbs.
If you are not an athlete (ie you don&#39;t exercise rigorously for more than 2 hours a day) you should aim to eat about 200g of carbohydrates per day. If you are trying to lose weight you should aim for closer to 100g. Lastly, if you are trying to lose a lot of weight (e.g. ~100lbs or more) an effective way to do it is to follow a ketogenic (aka &ldquo;keto&rdquo;) diet in which you would eat fewer than 25g of carbs per day. More on how to actually go about counting your macros below.</p>

<p>Again, theories and opinions on protein vary, but it is also well established that not eating enough protein makes it difficult to make athletic progress. Each day, you should aim to eat at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight. For example, if you weigh 165lbs you should eat 165g of protein each day. This will likely seem like too much once you translate it into food, but this is the right amount.</p>

<p>While it is possible to eat enough protein without eating meat, it requires a lot more effort, and most likely requires that a large portion of your diet come from processed foods (e.g. rice protein powder or high-protein meat alternatives). I understand the ethical implications of eating meat (I used to be a vegetarian for this reason) but it is very difficult to be in good health&amp;fitness and also be vegetarian (this is why I stopped being vegetarian).</p>

<p>As for fats, they should make up the rest of your diet. Again, more on how to count your macros below.</p>

<p>Summary: eat less bread, eat more protein.</p>

<h2>Micros</h2>

<p>So, 99% of food is carbs, protein, and fat. What about the other 1%? That&#39;s probably also important, but our present understanding of the relevant mechanisms is very rudimentary. The only thing to do about that is to hope to cover your bases by eating a lot of vegetables. Most leafy greens have high concentrations of micro-nutrients (especially kale, brussels sprouts, and collards).</p>

<p>The good news, in terms of health&amp;fitness is that vegetables are &ldquo;mostly nothing&rdquo; in the sense that they have very few calories. Put another way, they are made of water, empty space, micro-nutrients, and only a little foodstuff. This is especially true of leafy greens.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t pay attention to your diet and live in the modern western world, you are probably deficient in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. It is a good idea to take supplements of both of those.</p>

<h2>Calories</h2>

<p>A calorie is a unit of energy. The calories you see in labels of food in the US are kilocalories ie 1000 calories. From now on I&#39;ll just call them calories, when I technically mean kilocalories, to conform to US convention.</p>

<p>Saying how many calories something has is a rough way of expressing how much foodstuff is in a given food. This is useful because the composition of food makes it difficult to compare foods by weight. For example, a pound of kale has about 100 calories, while a pound of meat has about 1200. If you only ate kale, in order not to starve you&#39;d have to eat about 20 pounds per day, whereas you could get by on less than 2 pounds of meat.</p>

<p>The way we measure the caloric content of food is by burning it and measuring how much energy is emitted in the process. Needless to say, that is not what happens in your body when you digest food, and is therefore a crude estimate. So, as a scientific model the &ldquo;calories in/calories out&rdquo; model is obviously wrong. On the other hand, counting calories can be very useful to achieving fitness goals. Just keep in mind that there is more to it.</p>

<p>Some useful numbers to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pound of fat is 3500 calories</li>
<li>1 gram of protein is 4 calories</li>
<li>1 gram of carbohydrates is 4 calories</li>
<li>1 gram of fat is 9 calories</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of designing your diet by thinking about the carbs, protein, and fat, it is generally easier to do it in terms of calories, protein and carbs.</p>

<h2>Designing Diets</h2>

<p>This is where you put it all together.</p>

<p>Remember that everything is an estimate &ndash; your total daily expenditure is an estimate, you caloric intake is an estimate, your protein intake is an estimate, etc. In order to achieve extreme results you&#39;ll need to have some very good estimates. But 80% of the benefits come from getting it roughly right ie crude estimates are good-enough for most people.</p>

<p>The first step is to estimate your total daily energy expenditure ie how many calories you burn in a day. You use energy in two ways: existing (ie your heartbeat, digesting food, etc) and physical activity (walking, running, exercise, lifting things, etc). So, a good estimate of your TDEE will need to take into account both of these things. There are pretty good models for how much energy you use just by existing &ndash; this is called the basal metabolic rate and you can get a very good estimate based on your age, weight, height, and gender. On the other hand, the amount of energy you use for physical activity is highly dependent on your habits (do you take the stairs at work? how many? did you go to the gym?) and your environment (is it cold out?). So, the simple thing that most people do is to just take their BMR and multiply it by some factor according to their levels of physical activity. There are a lot of online calculators that will do these calculations for you. The second part may seem very crude but it works well. In general, the activity-based multiples are biased towards being too high. So, when choosing options in an online calculator choose the ones that make you seem a bit less active than you are.</p>

<p>Once you know your TDEE you can design your diet based on your relevant goals. The most obvious one here is weight gain or loss. If you want to gain weight eat more than your TDEE, if you want to lose weight eat less. Good numbers to start: shoot for having a daily deficit or gain of about 500 calories. If you don&#39;t care about your weight eat as much as it takes to get satiated without felling stuffed.</p>

<p>The other 2 parameters of your diet are protein and carbs. You can get a good estimate of how much protein you need from your bodyweight, as I said above, 1g of protein per pound of body weight. As for the carbs (and fats), find something that works for you. In general, you should not eat too many carbs, but if you find yourself eating more carbs than I recommend and meeting all your goals, more power to you. A good number to get started is 200g per day.</p>

<p>In order to finish putting it together you&#39;ll need to write some stuff down. Find all the things you&#39;d like to eat in a day and look at their labels for estimates of their calories and macros. Add them up and try different combinations until you find something that fits the numbers I described.</p>

<p>It is important that you choose to eat foods that you like and can eat without really forcing yourself. In general, try to deviate as little as possible from what you already do. So, if you really like to have your morning pastry, keep doing that and cut your carbs somewhere else.</p>

<p>In my experience a regularly-scheduled cheat day when you eat whatever you want and as much as you want is very helpful. For one, it makes everything psychologically easier, and for another some people maintain that this is beneficial in terms of certain hormonal responses. The latter is very shaky, but as a psychological hack the cheat day is very useful. Once a week or once every two weeks works well. In particular, having a cheat day is a good way to ensure that you still eat foods which you really enjoy that decidedly don&#39;t fit your macros e.g. a pint of ice cream or a jar of nutella. Yes, there, I said it: I eat both of those things just about every saturday.</p>
